# Tutorial to help me learn react+flux

## Notes
- *babel-node server.js* to start the node server. We will be writing the React components in ECMAScript 6 and will be rendering them on the server, hence we need babel compiler to convert ES6 to ES5. ES5 is used because the older server, where this new server is based upon, was written in ES5. So keeping the server code in ES5 will make it easier to port over.
